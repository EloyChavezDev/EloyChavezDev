# Introduction

If you've been following my website long enough, you might have known that I remake my website quite a while ago. I went from [Gatsby][gatsby-link] which uses [React][react-link] + MD to [Sapper][sapper-link] which uses [Svelte][svelte-link] + [MDsveX][mdsvex-link].

I had a comment section on my old website using [Disqus][disqus-link]. I want to add that to my new website but I think that's not really what I want because it requires a Disqus Account. While I was browsing through Github, I found [Utterances][utterances-link]. It uses Github issues to store the comments, I think this is great! I'm pretty sure most people who visit my website already have a Github account, they wouldn't need to create a new account.

# Installation

Adding **utterances** is really straightforward, you just need to go to [their website][utterances-web], fill the configuration, and grab the snippet. The next step is putting it where you want it to appear. In my case, it's below every post. Here's a short snippet to illustrate what I meant.

```html
<section>
	<main>
		<!-- This is the main content -->
		<h1>Comments</h1>
		{#if $theme === "dark"}
		<div>
			<script
				src="https://utteranc.es/client.js"
				repo="elianiva/elianiva.my.id"
				issue-term="pathname"
				label="Comments"
				theme="dark-blue"
				crossorigin="anonymous"
				async
			></script>
		</div>
		{:else}
		<div>
			<script
				src="https://utteranc.es/client.js"
				repo="elianiva/elianiva.my.id"
				issue-term="pathname"
				label="Comments"
				theme="github-light"
				crossorigin="anonymous"
				async
			></script>
		</div>
		{/if}
	</main>
</section>
```

I added an `if-statement` because my website has light-theme and dark-theme and **utterances** doesn't support changing the theme on-the-fly, at least _yet_. It's an [open issue][issue-link]. You could do something similar with CSS where you hide one of the comment sections depending on the active theme.

# Closing Note

I wasn't thinking about making this post but ended up making it so I can test the comment section XD

It's a lot shorter than usual, but still, thank you if you've read this far. Have a wonderful day! :)

<script>
  import Update from "$lib/components/Update.svelte";
</script>

<Update date="2022-09-29">

As of now, I updated my website to use [Giscus][giscus-web] because I realised that if I use the issues page for comments, it's harder for me to keep track of the actual issues :p
