**Nyaa.si Scraper** is a scraper that I made to play around with Rust and Deno. The idea came from my friend, but he made this using Golang.

It was a fun little thing to do in my spare time. It's also the first thing I made with Deno. Feel free to try it if you want :)

Both Rust and Deno version looks the same. Here's how it looks.
