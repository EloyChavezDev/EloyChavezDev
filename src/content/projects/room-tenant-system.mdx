A web application to streamline the process of borrowing rooms in JTI building for various events.
This application was built using PHP and Microsoft SQL Server.

We were not allowed to use any framework, so I built the entire thing from scratch using the latest PHP features
such as attributes to annotate the routes and the controllers. It's pretty much inspired from Laravel and ASP.NET Core.

The application has a simple authentication system, and it allows users to borrow rooms for their events.
The admin can approve or reject the requests. Please visit the project repository for more information regarding
this project.
