# About Me

Hi there! I'm Elianiva. I love building software and contribute to open source projects! I've been programming since 2019, mainly about web development.

I was born and raised in Indonesia up until now, though I'd love to be able to live abroad. I've been always interested in technology ever since I could remember. I tried to learn programming in 2018 but it didn't work out very well because I didn't understand anything and then gave up, but I tried to learn it again in 2019 and now here I am, working on a bunch of open source projects almost every day (mainly for [Teknologi Umum](https://github.com/teknologi-umum)).

# About This Website

Originally, I made this website as a place to keep my "notes", but I thought that wouldn't be useful unless I share it with other people. I also think it's cool to have your own website where you can do _whatever_ you want with it. If you want to check _all_ of my personal works, you can check the [project](/project) page or [my Github profile](https://github.com/elianiva/).

I use [Svete-Kit](https://kit.svelte.dev) with [UnoCSS](https://github.com/unocss/unocss) and [MDSveX](https://mdsvex.pngwn.io/) to build this website and it's hosted on Cloudflare Pages.

# Programming / Markup Languages

Here are some languages that I know or interested in. I try not to be too attached to certain languages. I think each language have their own pros and cons so it's better to choose the best tool for the job.

- **HTML/CSS**

  It's basically a requirement for an web developer. It's one of the first things I learned back then.

  If you want to see one of my work that relies heavily on HTML and CSS then check out [Svelteception](https://svelteception.vercel.app). I basically took random UI designs that I found on the internet (mostly from Dribbble) and implemented them. It was initially some kind of challenge that I do with my friends, but we got busy along the way and no longer have time for it. Quite proud of it to be honest.

- **LaTeX**

  I'm trying to get used to LaTeX because it's a very interesting concept to me. I don't really like Rich Text Editor like Microsoft Word, Google Docs, etc. Being able to create an article, CV, etc, without ever touching those editors is great.

- **Javascript/Typescript**

  Javascript is the first programming language I learned when I was introduced to programming. Nowadays I prefer Typescript because working with dynamically typed language in a mid-sized project is a bit painful. <br/>

  I mostly work on frontend and my go-to framework/library are Svelte and React (preferably using NextJS). Though I'm currently exploring SolidJS and RxJS.

- **Rust**

  I like Rust because it feels like a high-level language but provides low-level features. I also like Rust's ownership and borrow system, though I haven't mastered it yet. I did several simple experiments with Rust like [nyaa.si scraper]({data.siteUrl}/project/nyaa-si-scraper) just for fun. I really want to spend more time with it, but I don't have that many use cases for Rust (yet) and its compile-time is just awful on my current machine.

- **Go**

  I think Go is a nice language because of its simplicity and it has quite a bunch of standard libraries. It's very easy to get going with Go and make a simple API, in fact, I made [this simple API](https://github.com/elianiva/random-jp-api) for my custom startpage when I learned Go for the first time. Obviously the code doesn't look great, but hey, I made that in like a day or something, mostly spent for scraping the data.

- **Lua**

  Lua is a language that I thought I would've never learned. I used it for my text editor that I'm using called [Neovim](https://neovim.io) and my window manager called [AwesomeWM](https://awesomewm.org/). I think it's a nice, small, and very simple language, it's meant to be easily embeddable, so it doesn't have a big stdlib like Python. Also, LuaJIT is crazy fast for a scripting language.

  Although I don't use it that often anymore because I'm no longer using AwesomeWM and I don't use Neovim that often anymore.

- **Others**

  There are languages that I'm interested in but didn't mention like C#, Kotlin, Clojure, etc because I don't have much experience with them. Though I would love to use them if I have the chance.
