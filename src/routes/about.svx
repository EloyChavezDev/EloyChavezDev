# Who am I?

Hi there! I'm Elianiva. I love building software and contributing to open source projects! I've been programming since 2019, mainly about web development.

I was born and raised in Indonesia up until now, though I'd love to be able to live abroad. I've been always interested in technology ever since I could remember. I tried to learn programming in 2018 but it didn't work out very well because I didn't understand anything and then gave up, but I tried to learn it again in 2019 and now here I am, working on a bunch of open source projects almost every day (mainly for [Teknologi Umum](https://github.com/teknologi-umum)).

# What is this website?

This is my personal website where I put some of my posts and showcase some of my projects. Originally, I made this website as a place to keep my "notes", but I thought that wouldn't be useful unless I share them with other people. I also think it's cool to have your own website where you can do _whatever_ you want with it.

I use [Svete-Kit](https://kit.svelte.dev) with [UnoCSS](https://github.com/unocss/unocss) and [MDSveX](https://mdsvex.pngwn.io/) to build this website and it's hosted on [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/).

# What I Do

I'm a college student who codes as a hobby. I mainly code for web-related things such as frontend using React / Next, Svelte(Kit), or Solid, and occasionally backend using NodeJS with a little bit of Go and C#. You can see some of my works on the [project page](/project) on my website or [my Github profile](https://github.com/elianiva).

I love contributing to open source. I'm currently one of the active maintainers for [Teknologi Umum](https://github.com/teknologi-umum) organisation on Github. It's an Indonesian community that was made because there was no community that is 'general' enough, most of them are limited to a certain topic. I was also actively contributing to the Neovim ecosystem, seems like most people know me because of that. Although I'm not using it as my main editor anymore, hence the word "was".

I write [posts](/post) about different topics, though I can't say that I write them regularly. Hope you find a thing or two that's useful from them!

# Social

If you want to reach me then feel free to hit me up on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/@elianiva_) or Discord [@elianiva#7886](javascript:void). You can also [email me](mailto:dicha.arkana03@gmail.com) if you prefer that.

Well, I guess that's about it. Thanks for visiting my website and I hope you found something useful on my site. Have a wonderful day! ãƒ„
